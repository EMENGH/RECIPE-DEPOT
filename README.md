3. DESCRIPTION:

   The main purpose of this application is to offer a channel to explore, discover, and contribute to create a great collection of recipes. This repository is organized by cuisine types like chinese, italian, etc, to facilitate finding a particular recipe. It also offers the possibility to look at recipe reviews or add reviews to a specific recipe. This may give you a handy tool to choose from popular concoctions and perhaps it may encourage you to try some of these popular dishes.

   When users enter the application and click on begin on the home page, they will be in a new window containing (initially) three cuisine types to choose from. if for example they choose italian, they will be presented with a list of italian recipes with a brief description of each one of them. Users should be able to click on the name of a specific recipe to get a full description of the recipe. if on the other hand they decide to add a recipe, they can click on the link on the upper left side of the recipe page which will direct them to a page to enter all the information for the new recipe.
